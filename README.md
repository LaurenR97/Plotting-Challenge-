# Plotting-Challenge-

In this challenge we utilized to csv files which contained studies with different drug testing results on a set of mice.
The information gathered was then analyzed and used to create graphs inlcuding pie charts, bar graphs, box plots and scatter plots in order to visualize the data.
The interquartile ranges and outliers were also calculated for each treatment group.
